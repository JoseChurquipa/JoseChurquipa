### Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jose Fernando. I am a student at the Universidad Nacional de San Agustin de Arequipa in Telecommunications Engineering.

ðŸŒ± I am currently doing projects on related programming topics such as python. It is one of the most versatile programming languages â€‹â€‹out there, it can be used in many different fields. That is, it allows programming from video games to mobile applications. Is easy to learn. If you understand Python, you can more easily understand other programming languages.
